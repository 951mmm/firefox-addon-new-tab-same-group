# New Tab Same Group

**New Tab Same Group** is a Firefox extension that improves tab organization by automatically inserting new tabs into the same group as your current active tab — right after it, at the beginning, or at the end of the group, based on your preference.

## ⚙️ How to Enable Tab Groups in Firefox

This extension works with both **classic horizontal tabs** and **vertical tabs in the sidebar**.

If you don’t see tab groups:

- Open the sidebar via `F1` or View → Sidebar → Tabs  
- Right-click on a tab and choose **Move Tab to New Group**

### If tab grouping is missing entirely:

1. Go to `about:config`  
2. Search for `browser.tabs.grouping.enabled`  
3. If it exists, set it to `true`  
4. Restart Firefox

> 🟣 Note: This extension only works with **native tab grouping**, not third-party tab managers.
